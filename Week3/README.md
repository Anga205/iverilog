# Week3: Problem Statements

1. Write a verilog program to model a half adder. Generate the VVP output and simulation waveform using GTKWave. Verify the output and waveform with the AND gate truth table.

2. Write a verilog program to model a full adder. Generate the VVP output and simulation waveform using GTKWave. Verify the output and waveform with the OR gate truth table.

3. Write a verilog program to model a 2:1 multiplexer. Generate the VVP output and simulation waveform using GTKWave. Verify the output and waveform with the OR gate truth table.

4. Write a verilog program to model a 4:1 multiplexer. Generate the VVP output and simulation waveform using GTKWave. Verify the output and waveform with the OR gate truth table.

5. Write a verilog program to model a 4 bit ripple carry adder. Generate the VVP output and simulation waveform using GTKWave. Verify the output and waveform with the OR gate truth table.
